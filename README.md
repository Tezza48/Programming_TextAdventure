Text Adventure Game/Engine. Zork style input

This Engine is Created from a bare minimum framework provided for the Programming module I have tanken at University.
The focus of this is the Input handelling which implements Natural Language Parsing.
I designed the algorithm to Feel as intuitive as the input of Zork.
